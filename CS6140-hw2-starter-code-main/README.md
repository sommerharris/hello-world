The biggest obstacle on this assignment has been preventing numerical underflow on 'gaussian.py'. 
I've been getting a math domain error when trying to calculate the log likelihood, and my guess is this 
is a numerical underflow issue. 

On stats.py, pca.py, and gaussian.py, the code I used initially to test is in main at the bottom of the page.
stats.py had pre-written tests, and test_gaussian.py is still under construction.
